        <h2> Background </h2>
        Hi there! My name is Max Kunkel and I was born in Sarasota, Florida. I was fortunate to grow up with two loving parents and a younger brother named Noah. Leading up to my junior year of high school, I always felt as though I would major in visual arts as that is where my interests primarily lied. During the heat of the presidential election in 2016, however, I my interest in politics was realized and I began reading about politics and attempted to stay informed about current events. I worked on a local state House race the summer before I left for college and my interest in politics slowly became a passion.
        
        <h2> Professional Experience </h2>
        During my time as an undergrad at Florida State University, I got involved with the FSU College Democrats club and took on a leadership role within it. Then, in 2020, I made the choice to delay graduating a work as a field organizer in Manatee county on the Biden campaign. I talked to thousands of voters during that time and oversaw a group of volunteers. Post-graduation, I took on a role within the Outreach team at ActBlue where I still work today.
        <h2> Career Goals </h2>
        I am excited to earn my Master's degree in Mass Communications with a specialization in Political Communications from the University of Florida in August of 2023. I love working in politics and progressive spaces and hope to continue doing so throughout my career.
        <h2> Interests </h2>
        Besides politics, I enjoy:
