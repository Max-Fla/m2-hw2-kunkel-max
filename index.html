    <h2> About Me</h2>
    <p> Hi there! My name is Max Kunkel and I was born in Sarasota, Florida. I am fortunate to havw grown up with two loving parents and a younger brother named Noah. Leading up to my junior year of high school, I always felt as though I would major in visual arts, as that is where my interests primarily lied. During the heat of the presidential election in 2016, however, my interest in politics was realized, and I began reading about politics and attempted to stay informed about current events. I worked on a local state House race the summer before I left for college which is when my interest in politics transformed into a passion.</p>
    <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
    <p>During my time as an undergrad at Florida State University, I got involved with the FSU College Democrats club and took on a leadership role within it. Then, in 2020, I made the choice to delay graduating to work as a field organizer in Manatee county on the Biden campaign. I talked to thousands of voters during that time and oversaw a dedicated group of volunteers. Post-graduation, I took on a role within the Outreach team at ActBlue where I still work today.</p>
    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
    <p> I am excited to earn my Master's degree in Mass Communications with a specialization in Political Communications from the University of Florida in August of 2023. I love working in politics and progressive spaces and hope to continue doing so throughout my career.</p>
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>Besides politics, I enjoy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Going to amusement parks</li>
        <li> Listening to podcasts-- FiveThirtyEight Politics and Pod Save America are among my favories</li>
        <li>Going on spontaneous roadtrips/trips with my partner </li>
        <li>Taking care of the plants I accumulated during the pandemic </li></li>
    </ul>
